Important: SIGNALS is identic with someones else code we should rewrite it


Step1: mkdir a Step2: cd a Step3: mkdir b Step4: cd b
Step5: rm -rf ../../a Step6: pwd \ Output should be pwd like bash
and cd .. Error message directory not here cd .. we should be back at minishell directory
NOT SURE IF WE SHOULD HANDLE IT?

Pipes are not working as they should, maybe i have to rewrite it - 
a lot to write but i will let you know tomorrow 

cat << $USER should not close with User name just with $USER 


Thats all for now what he found
