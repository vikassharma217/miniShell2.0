Important: SIGNALS 


Step1: mkdir a Step2: cd a Step3: mkdir b Step4: cd b
Step5: rm -rf ../../a Step6: pwd \ Output should be pwd like bash
and cd .. Error message directory not here cd .. we should be back at minishell directory
NOT SURE IF WE SHOULD HANDLE IT? 
!!!!!!!!!!!!Update fixed the pwd Part so it is working, still need to
change cd .. but i have a solution 

Pipes are not working as they should, i found out because the way we are 
using tokens and the parsing to the command it is missunderstanding it
i will let you know tomorrow
